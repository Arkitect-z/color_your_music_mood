# color_your_music_mood
This demo records sound and - when music is detected - it estimates the underlying mood (emotion) and based on that it generates a respective color. If available, it can even set your Yeelight Bulb color (again based on the detected musical mood)

# Dependencies
Connection to the Yeelight Bulbs is achieved using this library https://yeelight.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Audio analysis is performed using [pyAudioAnalysis](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis)
